        <h2>The Northern Lights</h2>

            Stargazing is one of my favurite things to do. The scattered blls of twinkling light, the big, bright sining orb,
            <br>and the dark canvas all come together to paint one beautiful picture. It is almost crazy how everything 
            <br>is held perfectly in place. Each night gives a different experience, from the stars holding different positions in the sky, 
            <br>to the moon changing shape to different crescents.  
        </p>
        <p>Now imagine this times ten. Aurora borealis, or the Northern Lights gives stargazing a whole new meaning.
            <br>In addition to the already beautiful sky, bright pink, blue and green lights colour the canvas 
            <br>in swirls and gradients. The painter surprisingly found a way to make the picture even better. 
            <br>This can be seen in countries close to the Arctic Cirlcle like Iceland, Greenland and Norway from late
            <br>August to mid April. Add this to your list of must-sees because it is definitely on mine.

        <h2>Caribbean Beaches</h2>

            Who doesn't love going to the beach? Walking out to the glimmering blue sea as the warm grains of sand massage
            <br>your feet. The sun beating on your skin as you near the vast body of water that will provide some relief
            <br>from the heat. The shock of the cool water that welcomes your feet and eventually the rest of your body as
            <br>you walk into the water. The smell ofsaltwater becomes stronger and the water gently pushes against your body
            <br> as you allow it to carry you away.
        </p>
        <p>Not all beaches were created equal. Each one provides a different experience based on its different characteristics.
            <br>You thought a regular beach was good? Imagine clear water beaches that allow you to see EVERYTHING underneath,
            <br>or even pink, black, and white sand beaches. The Caribbean is notorious forbeaches like these. Pick a country 
            <br>and treat yourself with an entirely new bech experience.
